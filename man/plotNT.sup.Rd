\title{Plotting N-T plane to find appropriate timing for conducting an interim analysis for binary outcome}
\usage{
plotNT.sup(p0, M, q, alpha1, 
            xlab = "N: Number of patients at interim analysis", 
            ylab = "T: Number of responders at interim analysis", 
            col = "blue",
            main = "N-T plot",
            lty = 1,...)
}
\arguments{
\item{p0}{Expected response rate for the control arm: scalar or vecotr. the value between 0 to 1.}

\item{M}{Total number of patients: expected number of patients until last time.}

\item{q}{Allocation ratio of the treatment arm: the value between 0 to 1.}

\item{alpha1}{Critical alpha at an interim analysis.}

\item{xlab}{Label name for x-axis in N-T plot.}

\item{ylab}{Label name for y-axis in N-T plot.}

\item{col}{Line color. Default is "blue". For multiple p0, set the same length of color with p0.}

\item{main}{Main title in N-T plot.}

\item{lty}{Line type. The defalut is 1 for early stopping for superiority.}

\item{...}{Other graphics pararmeters}
}
\value{
A matrix or list with variable names \code{N}, \code{T}, \code{Z_score} and \code{P_val}.

Draw N-T plot for early stopping for futility

\item{x axis:}{N (Total number of patients at interim analysis)}

\item{y axis:}{T (Total number of responders at interin analysis)}
}
\description{
The package plots N-T plane for finding the appropriate timing for conducting an interim analysis in a randomized control trial.
The functions for interim analysis expecting early stopping for superiroity and futility are prepared respectively.
